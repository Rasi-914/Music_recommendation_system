Artificial intelligence's exciting topic of emotion identification research focuses on how well machines can recognize and comprehend human emotions. We explore the application of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for precise and effective emotion recognition in this talk. Multiple convolutional layers, pooling layers, and fully linked layers make up our CNN model. The architecture's goal is to automatically identify pertinent elements from face photos and forecast the associated mood.

this project consists of 

4 convolutional Layers
1 flattening Layer
2 fully Connected Layer
1 Softmax layers
Adam optimizer

CNN labeled face photos are fed into the system during training, and the model is optimized to reduce the discrepancy between the emotions that are predicted and those that are experienced. We use methods such as data augmentation to improve the generalization capacity of the model.
